Plot graph as described, bar graph to shows number of rows per drug, pie graph to compare gender of the mice being tested, plot graph to illustrate the distribution of tumor volume. 
Which shows that, Capomulin the drug being evaluated,  along with Ramicane, seems to perform on the same level.
Our line graph shows the decline of volume over time on mice, subject I509, which indicate a positive outcome as the test subject was treated with Capomulin and the size of the tumor reduced from 45 to close to 40 after 30 days. 
Finally, our regression test further exampified the positive outcome of the Capomulin treatment with a correlation coefficient of 0.84, a strong relation of the tumor volume and weight of mice being treated with Capomulin.
